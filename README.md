## Hello World! 👋

TL;DR: A passionate guy scaling startups with the power of people aka Communities!

I am a community freak currently working as a Developer Relations Engineer. In the past years, I have contributed to various communities through content and events and have been recognized for contributions to student programs by Google, Microsoft and GitHub! 

In my previous roles, I have helped multiple startups with community development, developer relations, program management, GTM & product growth strategies. My aim is always to "help developers" by working with product and engineering teams. 

 I'm driven by the will to create an impact and encourage diversity and inclusion in communities as we never grow alone but always with a community
